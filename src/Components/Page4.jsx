                All Women are mothers. They nourish and rear, no matter, where they are and who they are. As a mother properly manages home to inculcate divine quality and eternal values for children without mother's involvement it is impossible.

                  Therefore,irrespective of where she is, a mother plays a vital role to raise the child, maintain peace and harmony or uplift ourselves from within. No doubt this can happen only when mother herself embraces the value and spiritual way of life. Values and virtues are the matters which makes person god or goddess-like. That is why manu proclaimed that "Where women are adored, there the deities delight. To live and make alive in this reality women folks must uplift them- selves by cultivating virtues and embrac ing the path of spirituality, reality and eternality. To every child mother must instill that other men and women must be treated with noble thought and pure vision. Of course without walking path of spirituality, such fact cannot be given and embraced. No woman's life is lesser to that of any man. Hence, manhood must be brought in our life through spiritual practice and cultivation of positive tendency.
